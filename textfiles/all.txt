Whoa by 50 percent [I am more influential than] Stanley Kubrick, Apostle Paul, Picasso… fucking Picasso and Escobar. By 50 per cent more influential than any other human being
My goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater… That always sounds so funny to people, comparing yourself to someone who has done so much, and that’s a mentality that suppresses humanity
One of my biggest achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, can remove my ego, I think there’s hope for everyone.
So, the voices in my head told me go, and then I just walked up, like, halfway up the stage… But I just didn’t really want to take away from Beck’s moment, or the time he’s having to talk. It was kind of a joke – like the Grammys themselves.
I am God’s vessel. But my greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
I think what Kanye West is going to mean is something similar to what Steve Jobs means. I am undoubtedly, you know, Steve of internet, downtown, fashion, culture. Period. By a long jump. I honestly feel that because Steve has passed, you know, it’s like when Biggie passed and Jay Z was allowed to become Jay Z
Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and so self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book’s autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books
I will go down as the voice of this generation, of this decade, I will be the loudest voice.
hate when I’m on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle.
You should only believe about 90 percent of what I say. As a matter of fact, don’t even believe anything that I’m saying at all. I could be completely fucking with you, and the world, the entire time.
I don’t even listen to rap. My apartment is too nice to listen to rap in.
I’m a pop enigma. I live and breathe every element in life. I rock a bespoke suit and I go to Harold’s for fried chicken. It’s all these things at once, because, as a taste maker, I find the best of everything.
Y’all are acting like this ain’t the most beautiful woman of all time. Wait a second, wait a second – I’m talking about arguably of human existence. The top 10 of human existence… I don’t give a fu
ck what type of jacket she got on.
Visiting my mind is like visiting the Hermès factory. Shit is real.
If you read books – which I don’t, none at all – about how to become a billionaire, they always say, ‘You learn more from your mistakes.’ So if you learn from your mistakes, then I’m a fucking genius

I like some of the gaga's songs. What the fuck does she know about cameras.

Historic Milestone indeed! …
The two big Congressional wins in North Carolina on Tuesday, Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, have reverberated all over the World. They showed a lot of people how strong the Republican Party is, and how well it is doing. 2020 is a big, and very important, Election. We will WIN!
....VERY stupidly negotiated Trade Deals, and Illegal Immigration, are a tremendous cost and burden to our Country. They are BOTH coming along very well and someday, in the not too distant future, America will see a very positive change. Remember, America First!
Illegal Immigration costs the USA over 300 Billion Dollars a year. There is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN. Democrats could end Loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier, and faster. But it will all happen anyway!....
....IG Report, which showed him to be a Disgraced & Dirty Cop. Republicans have unified like never before. You don’t impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job. No Obstruction, No Collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the Democrats. Sad!
....Became Number 1 in World & Independent in Energy. Will soon have record number of Judges, 2 SC Justices. Done more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony & fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him. WIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony & James Comey..
How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military & Choice for Vets...
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee:

-First voted to take away Americans' firearms
-Then voted to impeach the guy we elected President

All in less than 48 hours. And you wonder why people can't stand this town.
Even the Washington Post, the Democrats favorite newspaper, supports passage of the #USMCA. Congress should pass it this fall and give a victory to hard working Americans across the country! …
Wow. …
Proud to announce that @TrumpNewYork has just been named the #1 “Best Hotel in the World!" Congratulations to our remarkable team @TrumpHotels 
Looks like we might be getting accountability for the Comey Cabal. …
Comey:
-Opened Trump-Russia investigation
-Put Peter “we’ll stop Trump” Strzok in charge
-Allowed Dossier to be used
-Leaked memos to get Special Counsel appointed
-Tried to trap the President at Trump Tower meeting

All while telling the President he wasn’t under investigation.
If reports are accurate that the DOJ is recommending charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe, I’m not surprised. As I told @MariaBartiromo Sunday, to do otherwise would be an admission of different legal standards applied to the same conduct for political reasons.
Hello Baltimore!
In fact, my views on Venezuela, and especially Cuba, were far stronger than those of John Bolton. He was holding me back! …
“This should have been over with after the Mueller Report came out.” @guypbenson @FoxNews
“We can’t beat him, so lets impeach him!” Democrat Rep. Al Green
“Dems have never gotten over the fact that President Trump won the Election!” @GOPLeader McCarthy
Some really big Court wins on the Border lately!

for the most ridiculous claim of all, that Russia, Russia, Russia, or Russian oligarchs, co-signed loan documents for me, a guarantee. Totally false, as is virtually everything else he, and much of the rest of the LameStream Media, has said about me for years. ALL APOLOGIZE!

	Being scolded by failed former “Intelligence” officials, like James Clapper, on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States, guys like him, Comey, and the even dumber John Brennan, don’t have a clue. They really set our Country back,....

	Just watched Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and many other Democrats, wanting to give up on our very successful Trade battle with China, which has had its worst Economic year in memory (and getting worse). We are taking in $Billions. Will be big for Farmers and ALL!
	One of the greats!

	Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a...

	SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!

	The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law enforcement away from out country, is ridiculous and will be overturned.

	Our southern border is unsecure. I am the only one that can fix it, nobody else has the guts to even talk about it.

	Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly.

	How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's "birth certificate" died in a plane crash today. All others lived

	Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag- if the do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!

	The totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence O’Donnell, for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize, is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible, corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years. So bad for the USA!

	There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent, Fake, or Corrupt! When the “Age of Trump” is looked back on many years from now, I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!

	Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly), I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS

	The Failing New York Times, in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history, got caught by a leaker that they are shifting from their Phony Russian Collusion Narrative (the Mueller Report & his testimony were a total disaster), to a Racism Witch Hunt.....

	...Thank you so much.  That's so nice.  Isn't he a great guy.  He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it.  It's just not fair.  And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party.  Also, also the people of Iowa.  They have something in common.  Hard-working people.  They want to work, they want to make the country great.  I love the people of Iowa.  So that's the way it is.  Very simple.
	With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job.  The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused.  Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible.  In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray.  Very simple.  Politicians are all talk, no action.  They are all talk and no action.  And it's constant; it never ends.
	And I'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and I'm a Republican.  And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians.  Because they let the president get away with absolute murder.  You see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to--.  Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.
	You look at Obamacare.  A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster.  People are closing up shops.  Doctors are quitting the business.  I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.  He said, I have more accountants than I have patients.  And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business.  And he was very successful guy.  But it's happening more and more.
	Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website.  I have many websites, many, many websites.  They're all over the place.  But for $10, okay?
	Now everything about Obamacare was a lie.  It was a filthy lie.  And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted?  Does anyone do anything?  And what are the Republican politicians doing about it?  He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect.  You can keep your plan.  And you've all heard that hundreds of times.  That's like the real estate location, location.  I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location.  But you have heard this about Obamacare.
	And it's disgraceful.  It's a big, fat, horrible lie.  Your deductibles are going through the roof.  You're not going to get--unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage.  And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore.  So it's a real, real disaster.  And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare.  And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it.
	Now, we have to build a fence.  And it's got to be a beauty.  Who can build better than Trump?  I build; it's what I do.  I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings.  Fences are easy, believe me.  I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border.  They're walking.  The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country.  It is so terrible.  It is so unfair.  It is so incompetent.  And we don't have the best coming in.  We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks.  You can certainly have terrorists.  You can certainly have Islamic terrorists.  You can have anything coming across the border.  We don't do anything about it.  So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border.


	Again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it.  Benghazi.  Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi.  Everything is Benghazi.  What happens?  Nothing.
	IRS, e-mails.  I get sued all the time, okay.  I run a big business.  You know I've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful.  I have done so many deals.  Almost all of them have been tremendously successful.  You'll see that when I file my statements.  I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay.  But I've always said, and I said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president.  Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many--  Look, Obama, what did he do?  No deal.  He never did a deal.  He did one deal.  A house.  And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay.  He got away with murder.  But I can tell you, e-mails.  IRS, the e-mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost.  If you were in my world you would know that e-mails can't be lost; they can't be lost.  So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are?
	They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it.  Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great.  But they talk about it.  And then you have a president that does an executive order.  Nobody even heard of an executive order.  He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.  Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.  Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it.  We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.  So we have to do something.
	Jobs.  China.  I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese.  One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it.  And I know them.  And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with.  We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.  They tell me that.  Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.  But they tell me that.
	And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries.  The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.  I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing.  They are devaluing down to nothing.  And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.  And they're getting away with it.  And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.  But you watch this devaluation of all of it.  I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.  And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.  You know it's one of those things, sounds good.  Be very careful.  Be very careful.  Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.  They have it set.  Don't forget another thing.  China became the number one economic power a year ago.  That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.  It was absolutely unthinkable.  So it happened and it's very, very sad.
	Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.  We got nothing.  They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us.  Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.  We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.  By the way, you know how they formed.  They took the oil.  And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.  So now ISIS has the oil.  And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take.  So we get nothing.  We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.  I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.  And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.  But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.  We have incompetent people.  They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing.  It needs money.
	We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security.  'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security.  I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid.  Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security.  And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.  It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things.
	Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.  We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.  We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.  We can't do it.  Can't do it.  We cannot let that happen.  You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other.
	Here we are in Syria.  We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.  Think of this.  We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government.  Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.  But think of it; think of it.  ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.  There are so many things; there are so many things.
	But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.  Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.  You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.  The power.  And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.  We've never had this before.
	We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there.  We're trying to do the right thing.  We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.  You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find.  The same thing is happening there.  And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.  And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals.  They're taking it out.  Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.  So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.  It's really, really crazy.


	So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.  If we don't--  The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed.  Bridges are collapsing all over the country.  The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure.
	I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai.  I go to various different places.  I go to China.  They are building a bridge on every corner.  They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff.  They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.  They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say "cutter" but I've always said "qatar" so I'll keep it "qatar" what the hell.  But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.  And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes.  The place is falling apart.  You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart.  And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.  So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.  This is inside, not outside.  And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.  In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor.  I said it's not an honor; they're just smart.  But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling.
	You look at all of the things that are bad--  I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.  You know the guard rails.  The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.  Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.  Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.  Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.  Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.  Somebody made a lot of money on that.  They don't know what is happening.
	So we have to make our country great again.  We have to rebuild our country.  And we have a long way to go.  We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.  Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it.  We owe it to other countries.  They're the ones that hold the debt.  And then we give them money.  We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies.  I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know--  No American company comes to see and comes to bid.  It's South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them.  What are we doing; why aren't they paying us?  Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing?  I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's South Korea.  You know whether it's China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea.  Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on?
	Now, we have a very important election coming up.  We have a presidential election coming up. And we have some good people.  Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details.  We have some good people.
	It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed.  He failed.  I mean I liked him.  Look--like him, dislike him--the 47% statement that he made, that's not going away.  The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away.  What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time.  It's not fair because it was a long t--  That doesn't work.  But more importantly, he choked.  Something happened to him in the last month.  He had that election won.  And let me tell you something.  That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal.  I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one-yard line, they go ah, ah I can't close it.  Or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament.  And there are many of them.  Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that.  You can't give somebody another chance, 'cause actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president.  I really do.  I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true.  So you can't have Romney.  He choked.
	You can't have Bush.  The last thing we need is another Bush.  Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing--  You know they copied it.  I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing.  But I said it.  I was the one that said it first, and I mean it.  The last thing we need is another Bush.  Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that.  But he's totally in favor of Common Core.  He's very, very weak on immigration.  Don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love.  I say, what?  Come for love?  You've got these people coming, half of them are criminals.  They're coming for love?  They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love.  And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama.  I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama.  'Cause Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months.  And then he appointed Justice Roberts.  And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts.  And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes.  So you can't have Jeb Bush.  And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win.  So Mitt and--you just can't have those two.  That's it.  That's it.  It's so simple.
	So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important.  And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters.  And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet.  He is reading it.  I mean give me a break.  Everything is read.  You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk.  And that's what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.  But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing.  No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that.  But we have to do something about these teleprompters.
	But in looking at these situations--  I built an incredible company.  And you'll see that.  An incredible company; a wonderful company.  I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing.  And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix.  We have such great potential.
	So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in:
	creating jobs;
	defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists--and you have to do that;
	reducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it;
	securing our Southern border--and I mean seriously securing it;
	stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere;
	saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it;
	repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country.  And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody.  And everybody can be covered.  I'm not saying leave 50-percent of the people out.  Everybody can be c-- This plan is just a basic disaster.  Nobody knows.  As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is;
	fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports.  And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump.  I just got the best hotel in North America.  I'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one.  I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress.  Right on Penn.--  The  Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama.  Do you believe that?  And everybody wanted it.  So, I can't believe it myself.  But it's going to be fantastic;
	and so many other things.
	I know what needs to be done to make America great again.  We can make this country great again.  The potential is enormous.  And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job.
	Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Beautiful.  Thank you.

Great news about the work we are doing on illegal immigration! …
Historic Milestone indeed! …
The two big Congressional wins in North Carolina on Tuesday, Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, have reverberated all over the World. They showed a lot of people how strong the Republican Party is, and how well it is doing. 2020 is a big, and very important, Election. We will WIN!
....VERY stupidly negotiated Trade Deals, and Illegal Immigration, are a tremendous cost and burden to our Country. They are BOTH coming along very well and someday, in the not too distant future, America will see a very positive change. Remember, America First!
Illegal Immigration costs the USA over 300 Billion Dollars a year. There is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN. Democrats could end Loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier, and faster. But it will all happen anyway!....
....IG Report, which showed him to be a Disgraced & Dirty Cop. Republicans have unified like never before. You don’t impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job. No Obstruction, No Collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the Democrats. Sad!
....Became Number 1 in World & Independent in Energy. Will soon have record number of Judges, 2 SC Justices. Done more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony & fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him. WIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony & James Comey..
How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military & Choice for Vets...
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee:

-First voted to take away Americans' firearms
-Then voted to impeach the guy we elected President

All in less than 48 hours. And you wonder why people can't stand this town.
Even the Washington Post, the Democrats favorite newspaper, supports passage of the #USMCA. Congress should pass it this fall and give a victory to hard working Americans across the country! …
Wow. …
Proud to announce that @TrumpNewYork has just been named the #1 “Best Hotel in the World!" Congratulations to our remarkable team @TrumpHotels 
Looks like we might be getting accountability for the Comey Cabal. …
Comey:
-Opened Trump-Russia investigation
-Put Peter “we’ll stop Trump” Strzok in charge
-Allowed Dossier to be used
-Leaked memos to get Special Counsel appointed
-Tried to trap the President at Trump Tower meeting

All while telling the President he wasn’t under investigation.
If reports are accurate that the DOJ is recommending charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe, I’m not surprised. As I told @MariaBartiromo Sunday, to do otherwise would be an admission of different legal standards applied to the same conduct for political reasons.
Hello Baltimore!

#FISA oversight falls squarely within the Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction We must address concerns outlined in the IG’s report I'm calling on the chairman to schedule a hearing as soon as possible after Congress receives the report …
The IG report on potential FISA abuse is complete Now being reviewed Huge

Documents we’ve seen leave little to zero doubt the FBI and DOJ violated protocol with the effect of targeting Trump We’ll see what the IG found

Hopefully we’re weeks away from getting the truth

’These Conservative Judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come’ said Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina who leads the Judiciary Committee and who has been speeding through Trump nominees” The entire Court System is changing at a record pace!
The  “This week the Senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th Federal Judge of Mr Trump’s Administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping Barack Obama’s pace and fulfilling pledges by Mr Trump and Mr O’Connell to remake the Federal Judiciary
work that way I have a better idea Look at the Obama Book Deal or the ridiculous Netflix deal Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress the “Congressional Slush Fund” and lastly the IG Reports Take a look at them Those investigations would be over FAST!
House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report sadly for them after two years and $40000000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION ZERO OBSTRUCTION So they say OK lets look at everything else and all of the deals that “Trump” has done over his lifetime But it doesn’t
“We cannot have what happened to this President happen again” Joe DiGenova  “It is time for Justice to come barreling in”   Can you imagine that with everything going on in this World the Witch Hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along A disgrace!

PLENTY OF OIL!
Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked There is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed!
sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States
Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia which may have an impact on oil prices I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed in a to-be-determined amount
Then on top of it all Kathleen Parker of all people wrote “In Case You Were Wondering Trump Won The Debate” True but what is going on at the  NOT Fake News!
Can’t believe the  wrote a positive front page story “Unity Issue Has Parties Pointing To Trump GOP Goes All In While Democrats Clash Over Ideology & Tactics Mr President We Are With You The Entire Way REPUBLICANS HaveCoalesced Around Trump”
GREAT progress on the Border Wall!
All Polls and some brand new Polls show very little support for impeachment Such a waste of time especially with sooo much good that could be done including prescription drug price reduction healthcare infrastructure etc
Thank you!

sound horrible and me sound guilty HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public He has been doing this for two years I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!
Rep Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress with millions of people watching a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call but he completely changed the words to make it
nice call with with the new President of Ukraine it could not have been better or more honorable and the Fake News Media and Democrats working as a team have fraudulently made it look bad It wasn’t bad it was very legal and very good A continuing Witch Hunt!
Obama loving (wrote Obama book) Peter Baker of the Failing New York Times married to an even bigger Trump Hater than himself should not even be allowed to write about me Every story is a made up disaster with sources and leakers that don’t even exist I had a simple and very
To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is I used the word Liddle’ not Liddle in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam Schiff Low ratings  purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong A small but never ending situation with CNN!

They are trying to stop ME because I am fighting for YOU!
WOW they got caught End the Witch Hunt now! …
fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up & twisted words into my call with the Ukrainian President to make it look like I did something very wrong He then boldly read those words to Congress and millions of people defaming & libeling me He must resign from Congress!
The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine The so-called “Whistleblower” knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong just like Liddle’ Adam Schiff
The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President who told the Fake News at the United Nations that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt Others ended in ashes!
How do you impeach a President who has created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country entirely rebuilt our Military into the most powerful it has ever been Cut Record Taxes & Regulations fixed the VA & gotten Choice for our Vets (after 45 years) & so much more?

In addition I want to meet not only my accuser who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the “Whistleblower” Was this person SPYING on the US President? Big Consequences!
His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber He wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason
Like every American I deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the so-called “Whistleblower” represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress

Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on China pertained to corruption not politics If Mitt worked this hard on Obama he could have won Sadly he choked!
The so-called Whistleblower’s account of my perfect phone call is “way off” not even close Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call Got them by surprise they got caught This is a fraud against the American people!
The Media is “Fixed” and Corrupt It bears no relationship to the truth The  &  are pure fiction Totally dishonest reporting!

As this sham continues remember this is supposedly an impeachment hearing — not a personnel hearing not a policy debate not a popularity contest 

But Dems are using a manufactured impeachment context to try to campaign for 2020   
“Poll shows Dems losing interest in Impeachment inquiry all across the board These Polls are actually devastating to the Democrats But the writing was on the wall He’s done so many great things He’s devastated ISIS & killed AlBaghdadi building Wall” Jason Meister 
Pelosi herself said impeachment must be “compelling” “overwhelming” and "bipartisan”

After 2 weeks of sham hearings the Democrats’ case against  is dead — and the only thing that’s “bipartisan” is the opposition to their entire charade
As Democrats charge forward on #Impeachment of  despite certainty of defeat don’t let them forget phony #Russiagate scandal they created out of salacious false opposition research It’s fraudulent underpinnings should disqualify these hypocritical putschists

Despite all of the great success that our Country has had over the last 3 years it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders (and others) when I am having to constantly defend myself against the Do Nothing Democrats & their bogus Impeachment Scam Bad for USA!
“Nancy Pelosi has no leverage over the Senate Mitch McConnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the House and she has no standing in the Senate” Brad Blakeman Crazy Nancy should clean up her filthy dirty District & help the homeless there A primary for N?
Nancy Pelosi’s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the US when it come to the homeless & crime It has gotten so bad so fast - she has lost total control and along with her equally incompetent governor Gavin Newsom it is a very sad sight!
Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi just because she has a slight majority in the House be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes there was no crime the call with Ukraine was perfect with “no pressure” She said it must be “bipartisan
& overwhelming” but this Scam Impeachment was neither Also very unfair with no Due Process proper representation or witnesses Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t allowed to have in the House Dems want to run majority Republican Senate Hypocrites!
Brad Blakeman “I happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective they don’t meet the Constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors so I would like to see a Motion to Dismiss At least 51 Republican Senators would agree with that-there should be no trial”
The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats said they wanted to RUSH everything through to the Senate because “President Trump is a threat to National Security” (they are vicious will say anything!) but now they don’t want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly Liars!
Democrats’ gift to American workers? Three years wasted obsessing over impeachment
 
Republicans’ gift to American workers? See for yourself!

“Look the House is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents BEFORE they send the articles over to the Senate not to call in new witnesses go through new documents - that work is supposed to be done in the House”  
& overwhelming” but this Scam Impeachment was neither Also very unfair with no Due Process proper representation or witnesses Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t allowed to have in the House Dems want to run majority Republican Senate Hypocrites!
Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi just because she has a slight majority in the House be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes there was no crime the call with Ukraine was perfect with “no pressure” She said it must be “bipartisan

This is your daily reminder that:

Barack Obama asked Ukraine to investigate his political rival's campaign manager

3 Democrat senators asked Ukraine to investigate Trump

And the DNC solicited Ukraine's help to dig up dirt on Trump

And the media was silent about all of it


“Democrats repeatedly claimed impeachment was an urgent matter but now Nancy Pelosi uses stall tactics to obstruct the Senate”     It’s all part of the Impeachment Hoax!
“Pelosi’s stall tactics expose the weakness of Democrat’s impeachment case”  
Merry Christmas friends! 
Thank you President  for making this Christmas amazing!!!

on 51 votes which is procedural You don’t need two thirds”  Brad Blakeman   A great lawyer & person Thank you Brad!
“It’s my opinion as a lawyer that the Articles of Impeachment are defective on their face which means I would like to see a Motion to Dismiss and have this disbursed without the necessity of a trial I don’t think there should be a trial I think it should be dismissed
Remember when Pelosi was screaming that President Trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly They didn’t get one Republican House vote and lost 3 Dems They produced no case so now she doesn’t want to go to the Senate She’s all lies Most overrated person I know!
Read the Transcripts!
Very good meeting on the Middle East the Military and Trade Heading back to The Southern White House (Mar-a-Lago!) Updates throughout the day
To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don’t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran this is your time!
I will be signing our very large and comprehensive Phase One Trade Deal with China on January 15 The ceremony will take place at the White House High level representatives of China will be present At a later date I will be going to Beijing where talks will begin on Phase Two!
President Putin of Russia called to thank me and the US for informing them of a planned terrorist attack in the very beautiful city of Saint Petersburg They were able to quickly apprehend the suspects with many lives being saved Great & important coordination!
Armed congregants quickly stopped a crazed church shooter in Texas If it were not for the fact that there were people inside of the church that were both armed and highly proficient in using their weapon the end result would have been catastrophic A big THANK YOU to them!
Iran killed an American contractor wounding many We strongly responded and always will Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the US Embassy in Iraq They will be held fully responsible In addition we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy and so notified!
The Democrats will do anything to avoid a trial in the Senate in order to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and expose the millions and millions of dollars that “Where’s” Hunter & possibly Joe were paid by companies and countries for doing NOTHING Joe wants no part of this mess!
Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday’s church attack It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers Lives were saved by these heroes and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!
thank you for putting that art piece from a museum on your story it moved me

happy new decade from the ranch
Soleimani killed 603 American servicemembers

Soleimani maimed thousands more with IEDs

Soleimani approved the attack on the US Embassy

He was plotting to kill more Americans

Yes he deserves to be dead If you’re lamenting his death you hate Trump more than a terrorist
If you’ve been to a VA hospital in recent years and seen a young man missing limbs there’s a reasonable chance Qasem Soleimani is responsible for it He’s unquestionably an enemy of America and I’m glad he’s dead and I’m bummed it was a quick death
Trump Middle East policy Seems sound …
Bravo to  for his clarity on  No apologies No regrets Astonishing that some in the American political elite are forgetting that Solemeini was a war criminal the man who directed Assad’s genocide  acted and what he did was righteous
Did You Know: 

Soleimani planned the 2012 attacks in Libya because he knew about the gun running to Syrian rebels that was going on out of the CIA Annex

He was responsible for Benghazi 

And now he is dead
I'm a reporter but I was a Soldier for several years and led a platoon of cavalry troops into combat in Iraq Qassim Solemani was directly responsible for the deaths of scores of American military personnel in Iraq

I'm not sad that he got greased Not a damn bit
Soleimani was a murderer with the blood of Americans on his hands—and plotting more attacks Thank God for our military who eliminated him

President Trump sent a message: the days of appeasement are over Target Americans and you will be swiftly brought to justice
MUST WATCH

Congressman lists every single high crime and misdemeanor committed by President Trump! Unbelievable!
At the direction of the President the US military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization
What’s really amazing is that we had been told to accept for so long that the head of IRGC Quds was able to direct operations to maim and kill US soldiers with absolute impunity because he was backed by the might of Iran? 

We need a new “foreign policy intelligentsia”
Forget Person of the Year Washington needs an Adult of the Year My  for 2019 below   … via 
Iraqis — Iraqis — dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Soleimani is no more
Neither were the Iranians and for pretty much the same reason …
This is a great book a must read! …
and more control over Iraq and the people of Iraq are not happy with that It will never end well!
The United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year for many years That is on top of all else we have done for them The people of Iraq don’t want to be dominated & controlled by Iran but ultimately that is their choice Over the last 15 years Iran has gained more
of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself While Iran will never be able to properly admit it Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe He should have been taken out many years ago!
General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many morebut got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number
Iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation!
This year hundreds of protesters were killed in #Iraq after #QassemSoleimani urged pro #Iran gov to use maximum force & in #Syria Soleimani played crucial role in #Assad regime crackdown on protests starting in 2011 resulting in death or disappearance of hundreds of thousands

Soleimani killed 603 American servicemembers

Soleimani maimed thousands more with IEDs

Soleimani approved the attack on the US Embassy

He was plotting to kill more Americans

Yes he deserves to be dead If you’re lamenting his death you hate Trump more than a terrorist
Did You Know: 

Soleimani planned the 2012 attacks in Libya because he knew about the gun running to Syrian rebels that was going on out of the CIA Annex

He was responsible for Benghazi 

And now he is dead
I'm a reporter but I was a Soldier for several years and led a platoon of cavalry troops into combat in Iraq Qassim Solemani was directly responsible for the deaths of scores of American military personnel in Iraq

I'm not sad that he got greased Not a damn bit
Soleimani was a murderer with the blood of Americans on his hands—and plotting more attacks Thank God for our military who eliminated him

President Trump sent a message: the days of appeasement are over Target Americans and you will be swiftly brought to justice
MUST WATCH

Congressman lists every single high crime and misdemeanor committed by President Trump! Unbelievable!
What’s really amazing is that we had been told to accept for so long that the head of IRGC Quds was able to direct operations to maim and kill US soldiers with absolute impunity because he was backed by the might of Iran? 

We need a new “foreign policy intelligentsia”

"Tell me all, old top," I said.

"A little more of this," he said, "and I shall sneak quietly off to the
river and end it all. Do you mean to say you go through this sort of
thing every night, Bertie, and enjoy it? It's simply infernal! I was
just snatching a wink of sleep behind the bill of fare just now when
about a million yelling girls swooped down, with toy balloons. There
are two orchestras here, each trying to see if it can't play louder
than the other. I'm a mental and physical wreck. When your telegram
arrived I was just lying down for a quiet pipe, with a sense of
absolute peace stealing over me. I had to get dressed and sprint two
miles to catch the train. It nearly gave me heart-failure; and on top
of that I almost got brain fever inventing lies to tell Aunt Isabel.
And then I had to cram myself into these confounded evening clothes of
yours."

I gave a sharp wail of agony. It hadn't struck me till then that Rocky
was depending on my wardrobe to see him through.

"You'll ruin them!"IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!
Congress & the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote & we got 3 Dems This was not what the Founders had in mind!
The Impeachment Hoax just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election must end quickly Read the Transcripts see the Ukrainian President’s strong statement NO PRESSURE - get this done It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!
“The reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic”    The great Scam continues To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history when I am so busy is sad!

Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia who spoke with President Putin of Russia & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels and maybe substantially more which if it happens will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!
“The States have to get the money to the people who need it”   And FAST!
 

Great idea! …
Mr President 
With total respect and recognizing you are doing more than any President has  Please have  and  consider my #Plan2020 (which I briefed you on)

The economy needs a lifeline- from the consumer up 
#Plan2020 is that lifeline …
Great to hear! CA’s Gov Newsom about 

“Let me just be candid with you I’d be lying to you to say that he hasn’t been responsive to our needs he has"

"The fact is every time I've called the President he's quickly gotten on the line"
 doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican
 
He has shown he is willing to work with everyone and that’s why you are seeing governors in both parties praise the administration’s efforts to beat this virus
“The last time America faced an economic downturn Michigan suffered mightily  is working overtime to make sure that we don’t face the same fate as a result of the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic” …
A big thanks to all the workers of ups usps Amazon etc who are still going to work every day risking their health to make sure people get their packages in this time of dire need #ThanksForDelivering
have been stocked up and ready long before this crisis hit Other states are thrilled with the job we have done Sending many Ventilators today with thousands being built 51 large cargo planes coming in with medical supplies Prefer sending directly to hospitals
Massive amounts of medical supplies even hospitals and medical centers are being delivered directly to states and hospitals by the Federal Government Some have insatiable appetites & are never satisfied (politics?) Remember we are a backup for them The complainers should
It wouldn’t matter if you got ten times what was needed it would never be good enough Unlike other states New York unfortunately got off to a late start You should have pushed harder Stop complaining & find out where all of these supplies are going Cuomo working hard!
Somebody please explain to Cryin’ Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods a very talented Admiral in fact New York has gotten far more than any other State including hospitals & a hospital ship but no matter what always complaining
We are leveraging the incredible power of American manufacturers and suppliers to make procure and deliver crucial medical supplies to our doctors nurses and healthcare workers
“We're at war with COVID-19 we're at war with terrorists and we are at war with the drug cartels    We're the United States military and we will defend our country" —General Mark Milley Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
We are fighting the Coronavirus on every possible front—and we will achieve total victory with the help of the American people
Upon information and belief Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on US troops and/or assets in Iraq If this happens Iran will pay a very heavy price indeed!
Congress must pass the old and very strongly proven deductibility by businesses on restaurants and entertainment This will bring restaurants and everything related back - and stronger than ever Move quickly they will all be saved!

We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks “P Act” all the way Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!
 "The President has put the Nation's 30 million small businesses front and center in the response effort"
Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels Good (GREAT) news for everyone!

White House news conference at 6:45 PM Eastern Thank you!
We are learning much about the Invisible Enemy It is tough and smart but we are tougher and smarter!
I will be having a White House CoronaVirus Task Force meeting in a short while May or may not do a News Conference after the meeting depending on new information Talks & meetings today are proving promising but a rough two weeks are coming up!
Thank you Gayle! …
 said "President Trump disrupts the media narrative so CNN and MSNBC don't want to cover it live and straight without commentary" when in reality the President is winning at these briefings by taking "gotcha" questions and giving a forceful response #MediaBuzz
 said "the establishment media have not admitted that they were wrong and the president was right" for banning travel from China "The media called him xenophobic" and continue to deny the president credit for positive actions #MediaBuzz
I agree! …
A very biased “journalist” …
A great & wonderful woman! …
Parts of Florida including Miami are becoming a major e of #COVID19 spread; with cases doubling every 35 to 4 days
Encouraging signs #COVID19 spread may be slowing in many cities especially northeast Mitigation is working New cases are nonetheless still building nationally; and southeast New Orleans sunbelt southern California Detroit among others; remain areas of significant concern
Corrected Fake News! …
Absolutely sickening that the Washington Post published this puff piece glorifying a vicious anti-Semite 

Not only did they refuse to actually address her long record of anti-Semitism but the only mention is paragraph dismissing it by pointing to fringe groups defending her
Thank you to everyone who is saving lives by staying at home this weekend 

I know it's tough but if we all work together and follow the guidance we will beat #coronavirus

Psalm 33:18-20 "But the LORD watches over those who fear him those who rely on his unfailing love

Let's be clear about what's going on:

Republicans are trying to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program before funds run out

But Dems are holding the program hostage to their unrelated left-wing agenda

RT to tell Dems to quit blocking relief for workers & small businesses
What a great story 

 has turned the Admirals Club at  into a mask-making factory! During a time of crisis it's truly humbling to watch us all come together to help any way we can …
The #PaycheckProtectionProgram is a lifeline for small businesses on Main Street across America
 
Congress must urgently pass additional funding for this bipartisan job-saving program
 
There’s no time to waste Small businesses need our help – and they need it NOW
Small business layoffs spiked 1000% last month 10% of the US workforce is now jobless This is no time for political games

I hope Democrats stop blocking more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program very soon American jobs depend on it …
The Paycheck Protection Program has been so successful for America’s small businesses that it is projected to run out of money in a matter of DAYS Millions more could lose their jobs and their livelihood

Democrats don’t care
Cryin’Chuck doesn’t have a clue Couldn’t care less about the American Worker! …
Speaker Pelosi has said she is aware of 'no data as to why we need' more funding for Americans’ paychecks Anyone paying attention knows differently

Republicans will continue to seek a clean vote on funding for the job-saving Paycheck Protection Program
On the eve of #Easter let us remember the ones who lost their lives to COVID19 Please try to connect w/ family friends & loved ones this year Take care of yourselves keep your spirits high Enjoy #Easter knowing we are all in this together
It is a great honor to serve the people of this incredible country  #InaugurationDay2017
Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!
Will be interviewed by  tonight at 9:00 PM Eastern on  …
So now the Fake News  is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe NOT China This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs and obviously want back in Sad!
Governor  of California has been very nice &  highly supportive about the great job we have done working together for California That is the good news but this is the bad He is unfairly under attack by the Radical Left Dems MSDNC etc He is strong! Will he fold?
I will be watching HAVE A GREAT EASTER! …
During our 152-year history in downtown Dallas Presidents Woodrow Wilson Gerald Ford & George H W Bush have worshipped at  We are honored that tomorrow President  will be the first  to worship with us live online Welcome President Trump!
Thank you President  We are honored to have you join us and are grateful for your strong leadership of our country …
The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn’t have a clue on how to fight and win Their views on Tariffs & Trade are losers for the US but winners for other countries including China If we followed their standards  we’d have no Country left They should love Sleepy Joe!
Watching  on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time We now have some great alternatives like

Kobe We love you brother

We’re praying for your family and appreciate the life you’ve lived and all the inspiration you gave
Media keep asking what the Trump Administration was doing in February to combat the coronavirus after restricting travel from China

There's a helpful timeline for that!  …
"We're very close to completing a plan to open our country"
Over the weekend the number of daily new infections remained flat

Thanks to the efforts of every American our strategies are working
President  offered his condolences to Americans across the south who just endured deadly tornadoes and severe weather
My deepest sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late great Stanley Chera one of Manhattan’s most brilliant real estate minds Stanley was charitable kind and a wonderful friend He will be truly missed!
First the Fake News Media said that it’s not fair for the President of the United States to be giving news conferences but it is the only way I can reach the American People as seen in the below poll
White House news conference today at 5:00 PM Eastern Thank you!
It is the decision of the President and for many good reasons With that being said the Administration and I are working closely with the Governors and this will continue A decision by me in conjunction with the Governors and input from others will be made shortly!
For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect
disaster the Energy Industry will be strong again far faster than currently anticipated Thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track in particular Russia and Saudi Arabia
Having been involved in the negotiations to put it mildly the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day not the 10 Million that is generally being reported If anything near this happens and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19
