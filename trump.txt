Historic Milestone indeed! …
The two big Congressional wins in North Carolina on Tuesday, Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, have reverberated all over the World. They showed a lot of people how strong the Republican Party is, and how well it is doing. 2020 is a big, and very important, Election. We will WIN!
....VERY stupidly negotiated Trade Deals, and Illegal Immigration, are a tremendous cost and burden to our Country. They are BOTH coming along very well and someday, in the not too distant future, America will see a very positive change. Remember, America First!
Illegal Immigration costs the USA over 300 Billion Dollars a year. There is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN. Democrats could end Loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier, and faster. But it will all happen anyway!....
....IG Report, which showed him to be a Disgraced & Dirty Cop. Republicans have unified like never before. You don’t impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job. No Obstruction, No Collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the Democrats. Sad!
....Became Number 1 in World & Independent in Energy. Will soon have record number of Judges, 2 SC Justices. Done more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony & fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him. WIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony & James Comey..
How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military & Choice for Vets...
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee:

-First voted to take away Americans' firearms
-Then voted to impeach the guy we elected President

All in less than 48 hours. And you wonder why people can't stand this town.
Even the Washington Post, the Democrats favorite newspaper, supports passage of the #USMCA. Congress should pass it this fall and give a victory to hard working Americans across the country! …
Wow. …
Proud to announce that @TrumpNewYork has just been named the #1 “Best Hotel in the World!" Congratulations to our remarkable team @TrumpHotels 
Looks like we might be getting accountability for the Comey Cabal. …
Comey:
-Opened Trump-Russia investigation
-Put Peter “we’ll stop Trump” Strzok in charge
-Allowed Dossier to be used
-Leaked memos to get Special Counsel appointed
-Tried to trap the President at Trump Tower meeting

All while telling the President he wasn’t under investigation.
If reports are accurate that the DOJ is recommending charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andy McCabe, I’m not surprised. As I told @MariaBartiromo Sunday, to do otherwise would be an admission of different legal standards applied to the same conduct for political reasons.
Hello Baltimore!
In fact, my views on Venezuela, and especially Cuba, were far stronger than those of John Bolton. He was holding me back! …
“This should have been over with after the Mueller Report came out.” @guypbenson @FoxNews
“We can’t beat him, so lets impeach him!” Democrat Rep. Al Green
“Dems have never gotten over the fact that President Trump won the Election!” @GOPLeader McCarthy
Some really big Court wins on the Border lately!
